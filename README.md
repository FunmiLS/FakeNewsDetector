# Fake News Detector

## Introduction
Given the proliferation of misinformation online, detecting and mitigating against fake news has become a pressing issue. The rapid growth of social media has amplified this problem, making it increasingly challenging for social media platforms to moderate potentially harmful content while upholding the principles of free speech and expression.

In this project, I create a fake news detector using feature engineering and machine learning.
