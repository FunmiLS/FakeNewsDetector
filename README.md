# Fake News Detector

## Introduction
In the light of the increasing spread of misinformation online it has become even more important to detect and mitigate against fake news. Fake news is a rising problem, especially with the growth of social media. It has now become increasing difficult for social media platforms to moderate potentially harmful content whilst ensuring the principles of free speech and expression is upheld.

In this project, I create a fake news detector using feature engineering and machine learning.
